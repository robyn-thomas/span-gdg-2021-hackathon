## Problem statement
Doxxing is the revelation of personally identifiable information (PII), including but not limited to full names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, familial information, with the intent to harm the target. 

Doxxing is a serious tactic used to silence or threaten women online, and sometimes attack offline. After women have been doxxed, they struggle to get their PII removed from the internet. Platforms are often slow to respond, and the only tools/services available are expensive. 

It's difficult to detect doxes because there are many legitimate reasons to share PII online -however, machine learning models exist to automate dox detection on high risk platforms.

## Solution
How could you enable a target of doxxing to remove their PII from unwanted sites?
